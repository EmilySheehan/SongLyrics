Look out boy's 
cause I'm a rolling stone
That's what I was when I first left home

Took every secret that I've ever known
and headed for the wall
like a wrecking ball

Went on down the road of sin
playing bass under a pseudanym

The days were rough and it's all quite dim
But my mind cut through it all
like a wrecking ball
